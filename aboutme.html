								<p>I a fresh High School graduate at RMIT University. My birthday is in September, so I am currently at the ripe age of 18, soon to be 19. My religious background is Mulsim and my ethnicity is Turkish. I am bilingual, able to speak Turkish and English. I went to Wembley Primary School and then graduated from Williamstown High School, now a student at RMIT studying a Bachelor of IT. I have a younger brother of whom I go to the movies and on 'maccas runs' with. My family and I enjoy going on holidays. Turkey, Vietnam, Bali, Fiji, Greece and Macedonia are some of the places we have been. Queensland is a usual summer destination we fly out to during summer holidays to enjoy the sun, beach and themeparks. As you can tell we love the sun and beach. Summer is my favourite season!.</p>
								<p>I am an extrovert and enjoy going out with my friends. I have many hobbies and passtimes, cooking and baking being one of them. I also enjoy reading, although I get busy and don't read as much as I would like. I am a very active person, hence I like to keep healthy and fit, and especially love to bikeride. My bike and I are inseparable. I am also very superstitious and philosphical and enjoy engaging in such disscusions. During the current Corona Virus global pandemic I learnt how to roller skate and cannot wait to show off my new skills. During the pandemic I am also responsible for homeschooling my little brother, who also goes to Wembley Primary School. My family and I have travel plans for the future and would love to visit more of Europe, so hopefully we soon can!</p>
