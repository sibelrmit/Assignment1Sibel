									<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Whilst browsing 'seek.com' I came across a job that I would say is my ideal future job. The position is a Senior Consultant in Data Platforms and Advanced Analytics and it stood out to me as I, if I were to work there, will be involved in numerous exciting projects across a wide range of customers. They are looking for engineers who also enjoy being hands on with relational data stacks like Microsoft, and the big data technology stacks like Spark, Hive and Python, which is tech based and what I am looking for. Additionally, the role is centered on leading and management, and using agile methodology to deliver great outcomes to clients, meaning it will require proficient social and management skills. Management and leader positions stand out to me because I enjoy the accountability and the idea of leadership and the delivery of outcomes to customers and clients. The position also offers training in the latest technologies, regular team event and the ability to reach out to vendor experts, meaning I have room to grow and develop. Lastly, the position does also offer a desirable salary as I aim to be successful and earning a lot in my future.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The position requires stakeholder management experience with the proven ability to establish strong working relationships, and experience and skills in data analysis. Experience in open source and implementing Big Data solutions as well as experience in implementing analytics solutions based on Microsoft Azure BI stack. Communication and interpretation skills, and strong consulting capabilities are also required for the position. I do not have the technical skills, qualifications and experience for the position as off yet. My technical skillset and experience is very basic and I have no qualifications. I have basic knowledge of database systems and management, and SQL, basic javascript coding knowledge to create basic outputs and running applications, and I have basic html coding knowldge, and am able to create websites. I am good at designing interfaces and projects however, and understand the role of the user when it comes to design. I am full of creative ideas.</p>
								<p>Obviously I have to work and build my skillset elsewhere, before I can apply for such a position as Senior Consultant in Data Platforms and Advanced Analytics. I have planned out the multiple ways how I could go about obtaining the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. I aim to apply for postgraduate programs after completion of my degree so I can have a job as a fresh graduate where I will be getting exposure to different areas of the business. This would build my skillset and potentially secure a solid position at the business by the end. Otherwise I would look for and apply to positions that accept postgraduates within IT departments and businesses. Then overtime as I gain the required skills and experience for this position, I would seek to promote to or apply for it as I would finally be a potential candidate.</p>
