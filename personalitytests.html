									<h1>Personality Tests</h1>
								</header>
								<p>The Myers-Briggs test told me that my personality type is the 'Protagonist'. According to the online results my strengths are: tolerant, charismatic, reliable, altruistic and a natural leader. My weaknesses include: being overly idealistic, too sensitive, too selfless, having fluctuating self-esteem and struggling to make tough decisions. The website states that protagonists are able to thrive in many diverse roles at any level of seniority. Their quality of being likeable people propels them to success wherever they have a chance to work with others, so they are liked in a team. People with the protagonist personality trait are sensitive to the needs of others and their open-mindedness and easygoing sociability make it easy for them to relate to their colleagues and team. However this can make it easy for their teammates and colleagues to shift their problems onto protagonistsâ€™ plates. This means that protagonists are great team workers, however their true calling is in managing teams, where it allows for their capacity for insightful and inspiring communication and sensitivity to the needs of others to fully shine. Their skill in recognizing individual motivations allows protagonists to use their natural charisma to boost and push their teams and projects forward. Known protagonists include Oprah Winfrey, Barack Obama and Ben Affleck.</p>

								<p>According to the VARK questionnaire, my learning style is multimodal meaning I am a flexible learner and can learn in many styles. The online test made it clear that I prefer visual learning where I can see how to do things and listen to instructions. According to VARK I predominantly prefer hands on learning where I can learn from participating in activities and trial and error. This is the kinesthetic learning style and I scored the highest in it. Next came aural, visual and read/write, clearly outlining that I am a visual learner and like to partake in discussion where I can ask questions.</p>

								<p>The emotional intelligence test confirms that I have a lot of social awareness. This is backed up by my results in the Myers-Briggs personality test, that explained that protagonists are very social, empathetic and charismatic people. This means I am adaptable to my surroundings and different groups of people. I am very self aware and confident and I am great at self management, able to organise and manage my time efficiently. Relationship management identifies my ability for teamwork, leadership, building and managing bonds and relationships. Because I am socially aware as well, I am a great team member and able to cater to my team members needs however I do prefer things to be done in a specific perfect way and like to be in control of that. When working in a team, an individual cannot be in control of every aspect of the teamwork because then it is just your work. So as a result of this, I must be aware that everything cannot be perfect, and let work be able to be handled and done by others in their own way.</p>
