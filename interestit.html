									<h1>Why IT and why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The IT savvy character has always had an appeal to me. Since I could remember, I always loved the geeky hacker in every movie ever growing up and to this day. Information technology is a very interesting area, especially important now because the world is so heavily involved in the use of technology and the cloud, with cyber security and safe technology/Internet usage being crucial. Growing up I got to experience the lack of smart and fast technology, and got to also experience its rapid evolution. I remember having a box TV and watching movies on tape. I remember the boxy, massive computers with floppy disks. And I also remember when my family discovered CDâ€™s and how I had to blow and clean the CD when I was to watch a movie. Then the first touch screen devices like iPods and iPhones came out and they just kept getting better and more efficient as I grew older. Now I can call on my Google Home device and ask it anything, with just my voice. IT was one of my favourite subjects in high school, along with philosophy, so I have quite a bit of basic and background knowledge on it. Because IT is so fascinating to me, I continue to study it at university and it is something I want to with my future.</p>
								<p>I first heard about RMIT in year 9 as it a very well known and reputable university. I had already made up my mind then because I knew I wanted to do something with IT in my future, and RMIT is a technology oriented school, its name is literally the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. But the real magic happened when I visited the campus for a tour on Open Day and got to see all the technology and resources offered. That was when it was a done deal in my mind that I will study at RMIT. It is also in the city, so it is easy to travel to and it also appealed to me that during my breaks I could shop and get food at Melbourne Central. In my studies I expect to become proficient in coding and building interfaces, software and websites, as well as skillfully designing such platforms. Perhaps, also become a master hacker throughout the duration. Upon completion of my course, I expect to be qualified to work in the many aspects governing the IT world so I can continue to experience IT in my future job.</p>
