									<h1>Why IT & why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Since I could remember, I always loved the geeky hacker charcter in every movie growing up and to this day. Information technology is a very broad and interesting area. It's especially important now because the world is so heavily involved in the use of technology and the cloud, with cyber security and safe technology/Internet usage being crucial. Growing up I got to experience technologies rapid evolution. I remember having a box TV and watching movies on tape, I remember the boxy massive computers with floppy disks, and I also remember when my family discovered CDâ€™s and how I had to blow and clean the CD when I was to watch a movie. Then the first touch screen devices like iPods and iPhones came out and they just kept getting better and more efficient as I grew older. Now I can call on my Google Home device and ask it anything, with just my voice. IT was one of my favourite subjects in high school, along with philosophy, so I have quite a bit of basic and background knowledge on it. Because IT is so fascinating to me, I continue to study it at university and it is something I want to with my future.</p>
								<p>I first heard about RMIT in year 9 as it is a very well known and reputable university. I had already made up my mind then that I wanted to do something with IT in my future and chose RMIT as my future school because it is a technology oriented school. It's name is literally the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. But the real magic happened when I visited the campus for a tour on Open Day and got to see all the technology and resources RMIT has. That was when it was a done deal in my mind that I will study at RMIT. The location of the University being in the city was another factor that appealed to me because it is easy to travel to. It also sparked my interest that during my breaks I could shop and get food at Melbourne Central.</p>
								<p>In my studies I expect to become proficient in coding and building interfaces, software and websites, as well as skillfully designing such platforms. Perhaps, also become a master hacker throughout the duration. Upon completion of my course, I expect to be qualified to work in the many aspects governing the IT and business world.</p>
