									<h1>My Project Idea</h1>
								</header>
								<p>The project idea I have come up with is to create an online website, using github, for a brand that you have come up with. This could be anything such as a clothing brand, makeup brand, skin care brand, shoe brand etc. The project requirements would be that you must design and specify what your online brand is and then build the working online website and personal database for it. Everything about your brand should be thoroughly thought out, designed and documented, compiling an extravagant portfolio throughout the projects duration. Things to consider when creating your brand would be: </p>
								<p> - Your brand name and logo!</p>
								<p> - What products you would sell (clothing, skincare)</p>
								<p> - Your brands company morals (like perhaps completely vegan products)</p>
								<p> - The customer groups your brand is meant to stand out to (parents, teens, young adults, elderly)</p>
								<p> - The price range of your products</p>
								<p> - Pictures of your product to use on your website</p>
								<p> - Where you would ship to (keep it domestic or allow international shipment)</p>
								<p> - What sales you would consider to draw in more customers, because who doesn’t love a sale! (Christmas sales, 50% off here and there)</p>
								<p> - Where and on what platforms you would potentially advertise on and why? (advertise on Facebook, Instagram, Youtube ads)</p>
								<p> - Security meaning keeping customer data, especially card and payment details, secured and safely stored</p>
								<p>The products being sold and displayed on your website can be dummy examples and samples, as the objective of the project is to showcase your IT abilities such as creating a working website and database, and the workflow from the time of browsing a product to the purchase of it. Hence, you do not have to also design a product you are going to sell, just have a general idea of what products your brand sells. When using photos on your website to display your brands products, you can use dummy samples that have been photo-shopped, drawn, or even general products you already own and have photographed. Additionally, you do not need to have a wealth of products shown on the website. A minimum of four different products is required. For example, if your brand is a clothing brand, your website should have four different pieces of clothing available for purchase.</p>
								<p>Throughout the project, students must have a portfolio put together showing their planning and designs for their brand logo, website, advertisements, and database and reporting on their ideas, project timeline, challenges and drawbacks, and feedback and results. Designing and building a brand takes a lot of time, hence why this project would have a long, generous timeline and would be made up of parts such as: the planning and designing, the implementing, the working, and the feedback. Marks are allocated to many areas such as the portfolio and reports, website, testing and database and will take up the majority of the semester.</p>
								<p>You will need to design your brand and logo, and then thoroughly plan and design your companies online website making sure it is user friendly, usable, and aesthetically pleasing. You will then choose a design you most like and create the website. Your website should be able to make customer accounts, have a shopping cart to keep track of customers products added to the bag for checkout, notify customers of products that are out of stock, and then be able to make the order and take secure payments. Of course, in order for your website to store customer and product data it would need to have a working database alongside it. SQLite is a potential database software to use for making the database. So as a further requirement of the project you must design your product database and customer database, ensuring that it is efficient and linked to your website, and both applications are kept secure and safe. </p>
								<p>Potential drawbacks or obstacles in the project could be having your website linked to your database, and having your website protect and take secure payments. Additionally, checking payment details aren’t fraudulent could be another potential challenge when going about this project. Even simply having the website able to place orders with working buttons can be a big challenge. Drawbacks and obstacles and how they were solved must be reported for the portfolio being put together.</p>
								<p>By the end of the project you should have a portfolio clearly reporting on and explaining the whole journey of the project, start to finish. All plans and designs, documentation and information should be stored in there and able to be read and looked over. Enough so that if you were to pitch this to a company you would like to work with, they will be impressed with your start up and thoroughly understand your brand. More over, someone reading through your portfolio should be able to potentially build your brand himself or herself from scratch, or apply the knowledge and reports to build a brand of their own. This portfolio and project is something you would showcase when applying for jobs and in interviews because it has built your skillset. With this project you will gain experience in stakeholder management, stakeholder needs and outcomes, business requirements and outcomes, data analytics, website and coding, databases, and time-lining and KPI’s. Furthermore, these skills are required for my ideal job. My ideal job emphasises its requirement for skills, experience and qualifications in data analytics, big data and database, and this project will help me build those skills and gain a lot of that experience needed. When having a customer database, you as the CEO can analyse data such as: product and service reviews, where most of your clients are from, what their favourite products are, what time of the year is your peak sales time and whether or not your advertising is working. Here we are working with data analytics and learning how to cater to customers, as well work with the analytics and data to better your brand. Additionally, creating such a database will build on my database skillset and experience for the job. Not only that, me being the CEO of the brand means I gain experience being a business leader and stakeholder, let alone a whole CEO of a brand, building my experience as a leader. </p>
